# SOD.StockMarket

Add's a fully functional stock market to the game through a cruncher app.
Some stocks are directly based on in-game companies, others are completely randomized.
All stocks are updated each in-game minute you can see pass on your in-game clock.
Every hour there is a chance for a stock to start a trend, these trends can persist for a few days.
These trends will raise or lower the stock's value by much larger margins than the usual changes each stock undergoes.
